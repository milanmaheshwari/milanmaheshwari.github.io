            <p>It just feels like yesterday when I first stepped into the Swiggy world as an intern. This was in 2019 when I was just a kid in college excited to meet new people and design cool stuff. Time flies quickly and now weâ€™re here in 2021. I recently completed 10 months as a product designer here, and this got me reflecting on some amazing projects I could be a part of.</p>
            <p>Designing a tipping experience being one of them. This little project is special in a way being my first ever project as a professional designer after college.</p>
            <p>So without further ado, letâ€™s get started!</p>

            <p>With just a few taps on your smartphone, you can get all your favorite meals delivered to your doorstep. While this feels like a magical experience, most of us donâ€™t know how a fleet of hunger saviors brave the forces of traffic, heat, and weather to deliver every order on time!</p>
            <p>Tipping is one way for the consumers to thank the delivery partners for their hard work. When it was first introduced on Swiggy, as a user you would be asked to add a tip right before placing the order. It made sense logically since all the order modifications used to happen during the checkout.</p>

            <p>Let me take you a little back in time, around the summers of 2020.</p>
            <p>It was the peak of covid-19 in India. People were very concerned about what they touched and ate. While many of us could work from our homes, our delivery partners were still out there, risking their lives to earn a living and provide convenience to those trapped in their homes.</p>
            <p>After the official lockdown lifted, we observed something shocking â€” a steep decline in the percentage of tipped orders! As a result, the delivery partnersâ€™ income from tipping was significantly reduced.</p>
            <img src="images/detipping/tippingdata.png">
            <p>We wanted to know what was going wrong. And how could we help our delivery partners in those uncertain times?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            <h2>Understanding tipping behavior</h2>
            <p>We asked users about their tipping preferences. What motivated them to tip and what was stopping them from doing the same.</p>
            <img src="images/detipping/userbreakdown.png">
            <p><b>Frequent tippers</b> usually had a high awareness of the effort put in by delivery partners and did so naturally out of empathy.</p>
            <p><b>Those who rarely tipped</b> didnâ€™t feel the need to add an additional tip when theyâ€™re already paying a delivery fee. Although a considerable chunk of these users preferred tipping through cash instead.</p>
            <p><b>Those who used to tip but stopped tipping</b> mainly due to reduced empathy towards the blue-collar workforce with the removal of lockdown. This was the main reason for a decline in tipped orders in the past few months.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 storysection storyhighlight">

            <p>In the west, tipping is strongly believed as an obligation towards those providing service and as a way to gain social approval.</p>
            <h4>The consumer market of India is largely value-driven. We see tips as rewards for a satisfying experience and to seek better service in the future.</h4>
            <p>Pre-order tipping which solely relied on empathy wasnâ€™t enough.</p>
            <p><b>We hypothesized that allowing users to tip after the order has been delivered can lead to an increase in tipping.</b> The initial validation was the cash tips people were willingly giving.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-3 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1 storysection">

            <h1>Designing the Experience</h1>
            <p>For our post-order hypothesis, the metric for order satisfaction was the delivery ratings. So we thought why not integrate tipping in the existing rating flow.</p>
            <p>I started with a multistep approach â€” first complete the delivery feedback and then proceed to tip. Something like this:</p>
            <img src="images/detipping/iteration1.png">
            <p>This approach sets the expectation in the first step thereâ€™s something more to come. But what happens if a user isnâ€™t satisfied with the delivery? What do we show if the rating is just one or two stars?</p>
            <p>Okay, how about a bottom-sheet? Itâ€™s always a safe approach to perform secondary interactions on the screen. And we could show the tipping widget only for highly rated deliveries.</p>
            <img src="images/detipping/iteration2.png">
            <p>This looked like it would work. But not yet!</p>
            <p>I started showing around the prototypes to the folks at Swiggy â€” who not only work here but most are avid Swiggy users themselves. I realized that people generally focus on the task at hand (in this case rating the order), and having a tipping detour made the journey complicated.</p>
            <h4>There is just too much going on with the ratings! â€” was the opinion</h4>
            <p>Okay, what are we trying to solve here? I thought. Our goal is to cater to the motivations of satisfied consumers. So why not allow them to decide how happy they are (by rating above 3 stars) and then nudge them to tip.</p>

            <p>â€¢ I tried to keep the interface minimal and simple, showing only the most relevant things at a glance keeping in mind the short interaction span that a watch offers.</p>
            <p>â€¢ I removed the map (which shows the location of the restaurant, delivery boy and the location to be delivered) because a complex task like interacting with a map is a pain on a smartwatch. Imagine zooming or panning on such a small screen!</p>
            <p>â€¢ The most important information that people will look for is the status of their food order. I tried to keep the focus on what is currently going on and how long will the delivery take, even in the notifications which are the most frequently interacted part of any smartwatch app experience.</p>

            <h2>Design Feedback</h2>
            <p>The next thing was to take feedback on the design from everyone. Showing the designs on a Sketch artboard was definitely not worth it and we wanted to get a prototype as close as possible to the real experience. So, Sapta (my design manager- this is we usually call him) suggested putting the screen images on a real smartwatch.</p>
            <p>â€¢ The most common feedback wasâ€Š-â€Šas a user when I tap on the status notification and go to the main app, it essentially shows me the same information for the active step. So, there was no worth of opening the app as no one was actually interested to scroll and see inactive steps.</p>
            <p>â€¢ The idea of removing the map didn't work. People actually expected to see the map as it works as an assurance that everything is going right. So, even if interacting with a map on a small screen is difficult, just seeing the delivery bike's icon gave an idea of how far is the food and if it's coming the right way.</p>
            <p>â€¢ There were some visual design problems like the ETA on wearOS looked like a button and many tapped on it; using an icon with the left aligned text on apple watch was making it cluttered; and how to decide the hierarchy of information: ETA, status, description.</p>

            <p>This project was a big step towards the goal of providing a more convenient and less distracting experience to our users. As part of the strategy, we were also planning to implement tracking the order with the help of Alexa voice assistant. And in future, simple workflows of order placing might be enabled on a smartwatch- like previously ordered items or Swiggy POP</p>

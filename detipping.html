            <p>It just feels like yesterday when I first stepped into the Swiggy world as an intern. This was in 2019 when I was just a kid in college excited to meet new people and design cool stuff. Time flies quickly and now weâ€™re here in 2021. I recently completed 10 months as a product designer here, and this got me reflecting on some amazing projects I could be a part of.</p>
            <p>Designing a tipping experience being one of them. This little project is special in a way being my first ever project as a professional designer after college.</p>
            <p>So without further ado, letâ€™s get started!</p>

            <p>With just a few taps on your smartphone, you can get all your favorite meals delivered to your doorstep. While this feels like a magical experience, most of us donâ€™t know how a fleet of hunger saviors brave the forces of traffic, heat, and weather to deliver every order on time!</p>
            <p>Tipping is one way for the consumers to thank the delivery partners for their hard work. When it was first introduced on Swiggy, as a user you would be asked to add a tip right before placing the order. It made sense logically since all the order modifications used to happen during the checkout.</p>

            <h4>Methodologies and Insights</h4>
          </div>

            <p>I knew very little about smartwatches or wearables and it was necessary to have a good understanding of how people use smartwatches, what problems they solve, things to consider when designing for them, etc. I began with some online researchâ€Š-â€Šyes! internet, the magical world where someone probably had faced the problem you're facing and is available to help you out.</p>
            <p>To better understand how the ordering experience really worked and what goes behind the scenes after an order was placed from the Swiggy app, I also spent a day with one of the delivery executives going from restaurants to customers, doing a few food deliveries myself on the roads of Bangalore.</p>
            <img src="images/swiggywatch/delivery.gif">
            <p>The people at Swiggy not only work here but most of them are avid Swiggy users themselves which means they have their own experiences, aspirations, disappointments, etc. from a user's perspective. Some of them used a smartwatch as well which was great for me as I could get so many insights from the team only.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            <h2>Some useful insights that I got from the research:</h2>
            <p>â€¢ Smartwatches aren't miniature versions of our mobile and desktop computers. Instead of cramming everything on a small screen, we should aim for <b>lightweight interactions, quick workflows, and simplicity.</b></p>
            <p>â€¢ Watches constantly move, are looked and interacted at unusual angles; therefore <b>their attention spans are low</b>, unlike the smartphones which demand complete attention and interrupt real-world activities. <b>Notifications and glanceability</b> rule the world of smartwatch design.</p>
            <p>â€¢ A typical food ordering workflow on Swiggy is rather complex. There are a lot of restaurants and dishes to choose from, people may change their minds at any point, even the tracking experience is not straightforward when something goes wrong and the customer support or delivery executive intervenes.</p>
            <img src="images/swiggywatch/flow.png">
            <p>â€¢ Apple and Google have provided their own visual language and design guidelines for iWatch and wearOS (respectively). One does not have much scope of deviating from the guideline as it's the way that a smartwatch user is supposed to expect.</p>
          </div>

            <h4>The end goal to achieve: How to make order tracking a more convenient experience for the end-user.</h4>
            <p>For the tracking experience on a smartwatch, I tried to break down the design problems that we wanted to solve in 'how might we' statements:</p>
            <p>â€¢ HMW design a more subtle experience instead of an immersive one.</p>
            <p>â€¢ HMW allow users to do other activities while keeping them informed allÂ times.</p>
            <p>â€¢ HMW benefit the holistic experience of orderingÂ food.</p>

          <div class="content">
            <h1>Solving theÂ Problem</h1>
            <p>I figured out that the value proposition of a smartwatch was to provide the core experience of tracking the order by providing just the right information at just the right time, without distracting the user from any other real-world activities. For complex tasks like browsing restaurants/dishes or contacting the customer support/delivery executive, the user could always come back to his smartphone in the digital ecosystem of his watch.</p>
            <p>With this, I could gather my thoughts and begin with some ideation keeping the HMWs in mind. I sketched a storyboard to visualize the entire journey of a character ordering food and how might he interact with his smartwatch.</p>

          <div class="content">
            <p>â€¢ I tried to keep the interface minimal and simple, showing only the most relevant things at a glance keeping in mind the short interaction span that a watch offers.</p>
            <p>â€¢ I removed the map (which shows the location of the restaurant, delivery boy and the location to be delivered) because a complex task like interacting with a map is a pain on a smartwatch. Imagine zooming or panning on such a small screen!</p>
            <p>â€¢ The most important information that people will look for is the status of their food order. I tried to keep the focus on what is currently going on and how long will the delivery take, even in the notifications which are the most frequently interacted part of any smartwatch app experience.</p>

            <h2>Design Feedback</h2>
            <p>The next thing was to take feedback on the design from everyone. Showing the designs on a Sketch artboard was definitely not worth it and we wanted to get a prototype as close as possible to the real experience. So, Sapta (my design manager- this is we usually call him) suggested putting the screen images on a real smartwatch.</p>
            <p>â€¢ The most common feedback wasâ€Š-â€Šas a user when I tap on the status notification and go to the main app, it essentially shows me the same information for the active step. So, there was no worth of opening the app as no one was actually interested to scroll and see inactive steps.</p>
            <p>â€¢ The idea of removing the map didn't work. People actually expected to see the map as it works as an assurance that everything is going right. So, even if interacting with a map on a small screen is difficult, just seeing the delivery bike's icon gave an idea of how far is the food and if it's coming the right way.</p>
            <p>â€¢ There were some visual design problems like the ETA on wearOS looked like a button and many tapped on it; using an icon with the left aligned text on apple watch was making it cluttered; and how to decide the hierarchy of information: ETA, status, description.</p>

            <p>This project was a big step towards the goal of providing a more convenient and less distracting experience to our users. As part of the strategy, we were also planning to implement tracking the order with the help of Alexa voice assistant. And in future, simple workflows of order placing might be enabled on a smartwatch- like previously ordered items or Swiggy POP</p>
